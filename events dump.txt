Our task is to protect it - to ensure that the balance of nature is never overturned.#In the past, I was much more lenient when it came to my true form. I never saw any reason to disguise myself from the humans.#I had even come to trust a group of them, for a time.#But in the face of power, human hearts are quickly seized by greed. They sought to use my powers for their petty wars and indulgent campaigns.#Once, I decided to aid a village that I had grown quite fond of in their military efforts... It was a long, arduous war in which I used my own powers to harm the very creatures I was meant to protect.#Not long after that, I decided to keep myself hidden from them - for both my sake and theirs.#And so I adopted the humble guise that you have come to know, dear spirits."/speak Raeriyala "But how can you fulfill your duty of protection in such a diminished form?$s#$b#Surely there are ways to help humanity without completely recusing yourself from their affairs...?$s#$b#Those people believed in you, and you yourself said that you cared for them - but you abandoned them...$s"/pause 1000/message "Your words have some truth to them, though it pains me to admit it. But I do not regret my actions.#I have never had any desire for humanity's love or worship. The task my kin and I were presented with is a lonely one, but nonetheless one I do not take lightly.#As a nature spirit yourself, you know as well as I that the balance of nature is easily swayed. Any semblance of favoritism on my part could swiftly prove disastrous for both humanity and the planet's development.#We watch over humans, animals, monsters, and even spirits such as you two. Were I to give my assistance only to a select few, they would thrive, yes - but the other creatures would indubitably pay the price.#What right have I, a supposed guardian, to sentence so many to such a fate?"/emote Raeriyala 40/message "That being said, I do not recall ever saying that I stopped assisting the humans entirely... *wink*"/emote Belinda 16/message "Well, then...
