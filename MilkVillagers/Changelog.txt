Letter from Marnie that Shane hasn't been doing so good/speaking with Jas and she's worried about uncle Shane

Player finds Shane at the beach, staring at the sea

Shane: sometimes i feel like i'm just trying to push back the tide. That no matter how hard and long i resist, eventually it will wash over me again.
Player:concern
Shane:I appreciate that you don't try and tell me to hang on for one more day. every day i hang on for one more day. some of them don't suck. some of them really do.
	I don't know if i'll ever have good days in the future, or if mediocre is the best i can hope for.
Player:*hug*
Player: q: what do you want to say? they will come in time. you just can't see them right now | it's the same for everyone. you just need to lower your expectations and then you can be happy. | most of life sucks, but the bits that don't suck are what makes it worthwhile.
shane: 
		1+3: everyone keeps telling me that, but I don't think they realise how much they are asking me to trust them. 
shane:I've had my expectations broken before and it hurt me so much. I end up so depressed that I need something to numb the pain, or take my mind off of it. that's where alcohol comes in...
shane:right now the tide is going out, but how long before it comes back in?
player: I can think of something else that can take your mind off of it...
shane:heart
player:heart

fade to black
you flash shane a coy smile, and start undressing. you throw your clothes further up the beach away from the shoreline so they won't get wet from the spray.
You gently but firmly push shane on to his back, and climb aboard his body, careful not to kick sand over him.
He looks up into your eyes, and you brush your hair out of your face.
shane:are you sure about this? I have to know that this is what you want, not that you are doing it out of pity. I get enough of that from everyone else in the valley.
farmer:This isn't just about you feeling good, it's about me as well. I want this, and sharing it with you feels right.
As you say this you carefully spread your lips and guide him inside you, sliding down his penis as the waves crash in the background.
shane:oh, %name. you feel just right around me. I guess you weren't just being nice about wanting this too? you're as wet as the shoreline!
instead of replying, you start slowly sliding up and down on his pole, savouring the feeling of fullness that Shane's cock gives you.
It's not long before a little moan escapes your lips, but it's easily drowned out by the sounds of the beach.
shane:%name, you feel so good. This feels so much better sober than drunk, I can feel everything you are doing.
You feel Shane starting to move his hips more, trying to time his thrusts with yours to feel more pleasure.
It's not long before your juices are trickling down onto his groin, and the sounds of the two of you making love start to drown out the waves.

shane:I'm starting to get closer, %name.
farmer:q:do you want him to pull out? Yes|No
		1: As Shane's orgasm nears, he pulls out of you and sprays the sand with his seed. You wait for his orgasm to subside, and he
		2: You feel that Shane is getting close, and you flash him a grin to put his mind at ease, then start grinding your hips against his in short motions to push him over the edge. His cum spurts deep inside you, and the sensation, coupled with the knowledge that his seed is deep inside you now, brings you over the edge.
