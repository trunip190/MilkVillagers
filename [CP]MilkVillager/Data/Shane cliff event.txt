It's why I left Joja Corp#It's still part of my life(break)It makes me happier to know that you don't. my biggest fear is that everyone feels this way but it's just me that can't cope(break)I guess Joja really broke both of us.(break)I don't know if what I have is depression, or just from giving up drinking. Hell, it might even be from dreaming about the past again.(break)*lean on shoulder.*\"

Marnie carries on like clockwork every day.#$b#She gives me this smile when she sees me, but it's the same no matter how i'm doing or what i've done that day.#$b#I feel like I could screw up in the worst way, let out all the cows and chickens, and she'd still give me that smile, as if just by smiling at me she can chase away my feelings.\"

/Message \"you sit there for a while, just leaning against Shane. You can tell that he's tense, probably anxious, and so you sit there, listen, and make sure he can feel you being present.#You can tell that his breathing is starting to settle and slow, and you take that as a good sign.#After a while he leans back on the grass and stares at the sky. You can see that the day is starting to come to a close.\"
/speak Shane \"it's getting late, @. we should probably head back before you get too cold. Thank you for being here with me - I asked you to come because I needed help but couldn't admit that to myself.#$b#if I admitted to myself I wasn't strong enough then I felt I would crumble#$b#Honestly? part of me wanted you to not come so that I would have an excuse to crumble, because I guess I still don't believe in myself fully.\"
/Message \"you lean back and cuddle Shane, resting your head on his chest. You can definitely feel the chill coming on.\"
/quickquestion null \"What do you want to say to Shane?#Do you want to do something to warm up?#We should head inside. I had a good time with you tonight.(break)I don't know if I can be very giving tonight. Talking took a lot out of me, and I don't want to leave unsatisfied.(break)Thank you, @. You make the good days better, and you make bad days like this feel manageable.\"
