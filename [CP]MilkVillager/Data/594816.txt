I saw you staring out of your windows so intently that I thought I should wander over and say hello.\"/Message \"*You're sure that Elliott is at least a little miffed by this, but you keep stealing his attention, and you can tell that he's close.*\"/Message \"*You slow down, making sure to keep him near the edge the whole time Willy is trading pleasntries, and you know that Elliott is really struggling.*\"/speak Willy \"I guess I should get back to the shop. The crabs won't get out, but the fish are jumpy today too.\"/Message \"*The window shuts, and you take that as your cue, the last few minutes of edging leaving Elliott moments away from filling your throat.*\"/speak Elliott \"*Gasp*#That was amazing, @, but oh so stressful!\"/question null \"#It wasn't just about changing how you viewed the sea.
