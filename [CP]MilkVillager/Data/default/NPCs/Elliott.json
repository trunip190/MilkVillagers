        "BJ": "I've been writing all day. This will be a perfect release, my love! I do however, have some carpal tunnel. Could you...?#$b#%*You pull down Elliot's waistband and lather his cock in thick saliva, and begin working his shaft, starting with a loose grip at the base and firmer at the tip*#$b#%*He moans with pleasure and smiles down at you before tilting his head back and closing his eyes. You quicken your hand movements, and flick the tip with your tongue*#$b#Almost...there...@#$b#%*Elliott shudders with pleasure, and you aim his cock at the opening of your jar. His cock spurts out waves of the thick, sticky, fluid*#$b#Thank you, @. I always enjoy our little trysts. Do come back later if you need any more, I'm very happy to oblige, and I always feel reinvigorated.$h#split#I could definitely use a break. I'm suffering from some dreadful writers block and this is exactly what I need to clear my head.#$b#If you could pretend to be a ship's boy then it would definitely help me with this part of my story I\"m working on.#$b#*You drop to your knees and pretend to be surprised by him pulling out his penis, faking a little bit of hesitancy as he encourages you*#$b#*You pretend to be inexperienced at first, but once Elliott is into it you pick up the pace, and suck as much of his dick into your mouth as you can handle*#$b#*As your eyes start to water, you try and swallow to massage his penis, and it's enough to send him over the edge*#$b#@, that is incredible!"
