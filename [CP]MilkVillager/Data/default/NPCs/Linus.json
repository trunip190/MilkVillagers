Society puts too large of a stigma on such a thing.#$b#%*Linus casually lifts his outfit revealing an unsurprising lack of undergarments. He smiles kindly and gestures to his organ.#$b#%*For someone who lives in the mountains he smells surprisingly little, with a nice, manly mush. You shrug, lick your hand, and start to work his member.#$b#%*Linus relaxes to your touch. As you increase your handwork, he makes no indication of losing control, remaining completely calm*#$b#I would get your bottle ready. I'm going to ejaculate soon.#$b#%*You do as you are told, and Linus releases himself in the glass container, maintaining a calm, almost serene composure. You cap the bottle*#$b#It's nice to help one another out. Be one with each other as well as nature. Thank you for having such an open mind."
