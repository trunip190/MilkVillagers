				"BJ": "Jodi and I...we haven't been connecting on that level lately. I'll admit, I've been seeing you around town and have fantasized about you approaching me like this.#$b#Didn't expect it to actually happen, though. Do you mind keeping this quiet from my wife? I don't think she'd be so understanding. Life is short, but I don't want to hurt her.#$b#%*Kent unbuckles his belt and removes his dick, already fully erect. He looks at you, a mixture of trepidation and eagerness in his eyes. You take the initiative and gently grasp it*#$b#You make slow, deliberate movements, looking straight at him. Kent closes his eyes and breathes deeply, his muscular chest rising and falling in line with the movements of your hand.#$b#You kneel down and take him inside your mouth, and he trembles as he feels the soft warmth. As you accelerate your motions, his breathing becomes more and more irregular*#$b#@...$h#$b#%*Kent tenses up and holds your head in place, almost forcing you to take the entirety of his load in your mouth. You deposit the substance in your bottle, capping it*#$b#Sorry...uh...got carried away at the end there. Hope you didn't mind. Stop by if you want to do this again sometime."
