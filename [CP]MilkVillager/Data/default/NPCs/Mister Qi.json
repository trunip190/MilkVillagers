Be warned, @, this will not be like your experience you've had with others in town.#$b#%*Mr. Qi lifts up his shirt and begins to lower his waistband. But where any genitalia would be is instead a blinding light.#$b#%*Once your eyes adjust you see what may as well be a portal to some otherwordly beyond. You reach your hand towards it, checking his face to see if this is safe, and he nods.#$b#%*When your hand touches the vortex, visions and sensations you've never imagined and could never fully describe crash into your mind. You can see time, you can smell space.#$b#%*It's as if you've been brought into the fourth, fifth, sixth and seventh dimension all at once. You feel a great understanding of life itself*#$b#That will do.#$b#%*As soon as it had started it was gone. You are left with spots in your vision and after images of some immense epiphany that is slowly fading from your mind.#$b#%*In your hand is a bottle containing what is possibly a rip in space-time itself.
