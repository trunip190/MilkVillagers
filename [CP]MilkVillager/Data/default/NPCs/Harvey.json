You don't have time to take out your bottle and take the full load into your mouth.#$b#%*You stand up, and as gracefully as you can, spit the contents in the container.

Here we go, my orgasm is imminent.#$b#*You grab a flask and hold it over the tip of his penis as he starts to ejaculate, collecting most in it, and giving his dick a quick suck to get the last little bit*"
