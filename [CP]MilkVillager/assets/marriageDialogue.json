          "FarmerCollectCum": "You free your penis and start using one hand to gently stroke it, and the other to massage your balls. You close your eyes as you start to imagine someone leaning down and engulfing your cock between their lips.#You pick up your pace as their imaginary mouth starts sucking harder, occasionally flicking your tip with their tongue. Your clench your eyes tighter as your cum starts to spurt out, painting the inside of your jar. You seal the lid with a contented sigh.",
          "FarmerCollectionMilk": "You glance around for a mo to see if anyone is watching you, then slip your top over your head. You start massaging you breast, and your nipples are soon standing proud, calling for attention.#As you start kneading in earnest, a trickle quickly emerges from the sides of your nipple, and quickly becomes a stream. The flow increases as you find your rhythm, and the drip-drip of it collecting in your bottle is hypnotising.#After several minutes of switching between breasts you are much emptier, and you pull your top back on. The fabric rubs against your slightly sore nipples.",
